# ValrTask

### Basic Vertx | Kotlin example

Initial MVP - Version 1
- No Authentication
- Minimum asynchronous functionality
- Basic Store + DataService implementation

Version 1 was done over a weekend and included is what I could learn of a new stack in this time.

### Next Steps

- Add Async POST (Update data insertion to use messaging queue/streams (RxJava))
- Add Authentication
