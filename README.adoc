= Summary

Included is a basic Vertx API example intended as a Tech Assessment for a job application at Valr.

Version 1 was done over a weekend and included what I could learn of a new stack in this time.

Next steps in project:

 - Add Async POST (Update data insertion to use messaging queue/streams (RxJava))
 
 - Add Authentication
